# Welcome to the React Template

Here you can find out how to use this React Template.

## Development

You can develop using `npm run dev`. This will create a live reload that builds whenever it saves the file.

### Creating A Chunk

You can create a "chunk" by using the `npm run create-chunk [chunkName]` command. This will generate the basic React renderer TSX code, HTML code, and CSS code and link them together for Webpack.

### Deleting A Chunk

You can delete a "chunk" by using the `npm run delete-chunk [chunkName]` command. This will delete the old generated code.

### Creating A Component

You can create a new component by using the `npm run create-component [componentName]` command. This will generate the TSX class component and CSS code and link them together for Webpack.

### Deleting A Component

You can delete a component by using the `npm run delete-component [componentName]` command. This will delete the old generated code.

## Production

You can create a production output using `npm run build`. This will compress the files and make them ready for production!
